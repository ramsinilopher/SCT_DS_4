This is my final task in SkillCraft Technology Internship.
Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It includes visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors to provide insights for improving road safety and traffic management.

Project Features

Data Cleaning

Handles missing values by filling or dropping data as appropriate.

Drops columns with excessive missing values.

Extracts time-related features (e.g., hour of the day) for temporal analysis.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Accidents by Time of Day: Identifies peak accident hours using histograms.

Weather Conditions: Analyzes the impact of weather on accident frequency.

Road Surface Conditions: Examines accidents based on road conditions (e.g., wet, icy).

Road Type: Highlights the types of roads where accidents are most frequent.

Accident Severity: Explores the distribution of accident severity levels.

Accident Hotspots: Visualizes dense accident areas using hexbin plots and heatmaps.

Technologies Used

Python Libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

numpy: Numerical operations.

seaborn and matplotlib: Data visualization.
